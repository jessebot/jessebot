#### Currently working on

- zero unread GitHub notifications (the hardest challenge of my career)
- Mutual TLS pass of all my personal k8s infra - a larger project than I realized
- Tinkering with supporting [openbao](https://openbao.org/) in [smol-k8s-lab](https://github.com/small-hack/smol-k8s-lab)
- [onboardme](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme/tree/feature/add-tui) is getting its first TUI
- [nextcloud helm chart](https://github.com/nextcloud/helm) support always when I have a spare moment ðŸ©µ

You can always find me interacting in various repos related to TUIs, Kubernetes (especially anything related to helm charts... so many helm charts and Argo CD repos) or some sort of IaC or OAuth/OIDC or CI/CD thingy. I also spend a lot of time working on lifts and shifts of "not built for the cloud" software.

For fun, I regularly update my [star lists](https://github.com/jessebot?tab=stars) with projects I find interesting. I do refinements once every 6 months or so.

Huge thank you to the open source community for helping to make my dreams come true ðŸ’™
