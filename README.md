#### Currently working on

- getting forgejo and ghost setup with @cloudymax
  - then I'll be migrating everything here to Forgejo and the really important stuff will be backed up to codeberg. All of my repos here will slowly become public archives.
- zero unread GitHub notifications (the second hardest challenge of my career)
- Settuping up OPA or Kyverno
- Tinkering with supporting [openbao](https://openbao.org/) in [smol-k8s-lab](https://github.com/small-hack/smol-k8s-lab)
- [onboardme](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme/tree/feature/add-tui) is getting its first TUI
- [nextcloud helm chart](https://github.com/nextcloud/helm) support always when I have a spare moment ðŸ©µ

You can always find me interacting in various repos related to TUIs, Kubernetes (especially anything related to helm charts... so many helm charts and Argo CD repos) or some sort of IaC or OAuth/OIDC or CI/CD thingy. I also spend a lot of time working on lifts and shifts of "not built for the cloud" software.

For fun, I regularly update my [star lists](https://github.com/jessebot?tab=stars) with projects I find interesting. I do refinements once every 6 months or so.

Huge thank you to the open source community for helping to make my dreams come true ðŸ’™
