I'm extremely active on GitLab and GitHub as I really care about not only documenting my work, but making it available for use for others in the future. This includes fixing documentation and minor bugs in external repos. I also regularly update my [star lists](https://github.com/jessebot?tab=stars) with projects I find interesting. My most actively maintained personal repos are: 

|Repo|Why|
|:---:|:---|
| [smol_k8s_lab](https://github.com/jessebot/smol_k8s_homelab) | Quickly installs a small distribution of k8s (Kubernetes), as well as [docs](https://jessebot.github.io/smol_k8s_homelab/) for somethings I know about k8s. |
| [onboardme](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme) | Environment setup for macOS or Debian based distros, as well as [docs](https://jessebot.github.io/onboardme) for everything I know about personal computing. |

Right now, I'm playing with Nextcloud and so this is a pretty good desciption of what I'm up to:
