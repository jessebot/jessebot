#### Currently working on

|     Project       | Description |
|:-----------------:|:------------| 
| ðŸ’» [onboardme]    | Cross-platform daily driver desktop environment CLI setup tool, with [manuals][1].|
| ðŸ§¸ [smol-k8s-lab] | CLI tool to quickly install a slim distro of k8s.                                 |

You can also find me following up on various helm chart repos (k8up, nextcloud, ArgoCD, etc), or talking about images in terminal emulator/multiplexer repos. Huge thank you to everyone in the open source community who help make my dreams come true (mostly self hosted cat gifs in my terminal... at scale ðŸ¤·).

I also regularly update my [star lists] with projects I find interesting.
