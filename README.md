#### Currently working on
Pinned projects below, but you can also find me following up on various helm chart repos (k8up, ArgoCD, etc), or talking about images in terminal emulator/multiplexer repos. Huge thank you to the open source community for helping to make my dreams come true (mostly self hosted cat gifs in my terminal... at scale ðŸ¤·).

I also regularly update my [star lists] with projects I find interesting.
