#### Currently working on
Disconnecting from Google/Twitter in every possible way, while maintaining secure and reliable open source infrastructure with minimal effort. You can also find me interacting in various repos related to k8s, TUIs, or some sort of IaC or CI/CD thing.

For fun, I regularly update my [star lists](https://github.com/jessebot?tab=stars) with projects I find interesting.

Huge thank you to the open source community for helping to make my dreams come true ðŸ’™
