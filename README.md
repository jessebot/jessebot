#### Currently working on
Disconnecting from Google/Twitter in every possible way, while maintaining _secure **enough**_ and reliable open source infrastructure with minimal effort (but I actually put in a lot of effort). You can find me interacting in various repos related to TUIs, Kubernetes (especially helm charts... so many helm charts) or some sort of IaC or CI/CD thing. I also spend a lot of time working on lifts and shifts of "not built for the cloud" software.

For fun, I regularly update my [star lists](https://github.com/jessebot?tab=stars) with projects I find interesting. I do refinements once every 6 months or so.

Huge thank you to the open source community for helping to make my dreams come true ðŸ’™
