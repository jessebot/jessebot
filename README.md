My most actively maintained personal repos are [onboardme][0], a cross-platform daily driver desktop setup environment setup tool, complete with [manuals][1], and [smol_k8s_lab][2], a tool to quickly install a small distro of k8s as well as [docs][3] for tips, tricks, and tutorials.

I also regularly update my [star lists][4] with projects I find interesting.
